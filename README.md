# Introduction
Hey there! üëã
Welcome to my deep dive into the data analytics job market.
In this project, I break down the highest-paying roles, most in-demand skills, and where big salaries meet big opportunities ‚Äî all through the lens of SQL-driven analysis.

üíª Check out all the queries and insights here: [project_sql](/project_sql/).

# Project Inspiration
Curious about where the real opportunities lie for data analysts, I launched this project to decode the market:
Which skills command the biggest paychecks? Which ones are truly in demand?
By answering these questions, I aimed to sharpen my own career strategy and help others navigate the data job landscape more effectively.

The dataset powering this exploration comes from Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL course (link here).
It‚Äôs packed with information on job titles, salaries, skills, and locations ‚Äî the perfect playground for SQL-driven analysis.

### üîç Key Questions Behind the Analysis
- Which data analyst roles offer the highest salaries?
- What technical skills are most common among top earners?
- Which skills are consistently in high demand?
- How do different skills impact salary outcomes?
- What skill set should a data analyst master to maximize career value?

# Tools Used in Project
To power this analysis, I worked with a solid set of tools, namely:
 - **SQL** ‚Äî The backbone of the project, used to dig into the data, run complex queries, and surface actionable insights.

- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî My database of choice for managing, querying, and transforming the job market dataset with speed and reliability.

- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äî My go-to code editor for writing, tweaking, and executing SQL queries, all within a streamlined, developer-friendly environment.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project was designed to explore distinct facets of the data analyst job market. Here's an overview of how I tackled each research question.
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To zoom in on the best-paying opportunities, I filtered data analyst roles based on average annual salary and remote work options.
By running targeted SQL queries, I surfaced the highest-value positions ‚Äî giving a clear view of where the top earning potential lies in the data analytics space.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_posted_date,
    job_schedule_type,
    company_dim.company_id,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The **Main Findings** from this analysis:

- **Job Positions**: The data includes various full-time positions for data analysts, with titles such as "Data Analyst," "Director of Analytics," and "Principal Data Analyst."

 - **Locations** : All positions are remote or location-flexible, listed as "Anywhere."

LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    *,
    skills AS job_skills_required
